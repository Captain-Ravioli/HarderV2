# HarderV2
An ULTRAKILL mod that lets you modify V2's health and damage for a harder experience.

When you boot the game, you'll see a list of variables to change like "Boss Label," what text will appear on V2's health bar, "Health," and "Damage Multiplier." Change these values and load up 4-4 and you're good to go.
